# Flash Card App
## Description
*This application is for language learning, specifically to learn the Russian language. The methodology employed is learning through repetition and memorization.*

### 
1. When opened, the app will display the a card with a word written in Russian.
2. The user has 5 seconds to guess the english translation before time runs out
3. and the card automatically flips to the back side, showing the english meaning of the russian word.
4. User has two options/buttons: correct, incorrect.
5. Allow the user to click "correct" if they guessed correctly, or "incorrect" if they missed

> [!NOTE]
> The game contains up to 50.000 cards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the user correctly guesses a card and presses the "correct" button, the game will remove that card from the list-to-learn. This avoids repeated challenges and tracks user progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The game ends when the user successfully guesses all words in the list.
