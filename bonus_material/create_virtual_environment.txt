VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT CREATION
==============================

---------------------
Fundamentals
---------------------

1. It's different to manage the venv in a CLI such as CMD or
powershell.

2. The executable (.ps1, .bat) to activate the venv depends on the machine
and CLI we're on.

3. Commands:
- pip list
# Lists all the the installed pacakges

- pip --version
- python version
# cmd Commands

- dir
# lists all the files and folders of the cwd.

- cd
# Changes the cwd.

---------------------
Step-by-Step
---------------------

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Create the virtual env.
- python -m venv venv 
# Here we use the venv module to create the dir 'venv' containing the virtual environment files.

NOTE: The following step has to be done in WINDOWS POWERSHELL (as admin is better).
3. Activate the venv (windows).
- venv\Scripts\activate(.bat)
# Once activated, the terminal will indicate that I'm working within the venv. (.bat) Is optional in case is necessary for the activation.

4. Install the required packages
pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium pandas requests

5. Create the 'requirements' file:
- pip freeze > requirements.txt
# 'pip freeze' generates the list of all installed packages and their versions.

6. Deactivate the venv
deactivate

-----------------
Additional Tips
-----------------

1. To update a package to its latest version, use pip install --upgrade <package_name>.
2. To uninstall a package, use pip uninstall <package_name>.
3. You can share your requirements.txt file with others to easily recreate your project's environment.
